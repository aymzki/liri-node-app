# LIRI App 

A command line Node app that returns data. LIRI stands for Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface. We can find information on concerts, music, and movies. 

## Deployment

* Clone repo.
* Run npm install.
* Click submit
* At command prompt run node liri.js <pass in an instruction from above>

## How It Works

Enter any of the following commands, along with a search term:
* ###concert-this  
  When you enter concert-this with an artist name (this example is "concert-this Billie Eilish") an API call will be made to return data on the upcoming concert dates and venues, and locations the artist will be performing at.

* ###spotify-this-song  
  When you enter spotify-this-song with a song name (this example is "spotify-this-song Thriller") an axios call will be made to return data on songs of that title.

* ###movie-this  When you enter 
  When you enter movie-this with a movie title (this example is "movie-this Moana") an axios call will be made to return data on a movie of that title.
